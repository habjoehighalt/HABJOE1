HABJOE1
=======

This was our first flight, and I would encourage you not to copy this code, it works well but it can/and has later
been much improved

This is the flight s/w for HABJOE1. There were two Arduinos:

X = Uno, with sparkfun SD shield, Ublox GPS, and accelerometer, and three colour LED module.
Y = Mini Pro, with Motorola Mobile phone, and NTX2 connected 

X -> Y via software serial.
